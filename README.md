# Blockchain Module üåê‚õìÔ∏è:
In this repository, I am going to upload all the practice codes, smart contracts, self-dev coins, workspace code, and much more related to Blockchain, WEB3, and Solidity.
![Designer](https://github.com/SINGHxTUSHAR/BlockchainExperiments/assets/113624520/2334eee6-23a4-4f6e-8980-7147f71713c3)

### `Blockchain:`

* Underpins cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps).
* Distributed digital ledger recording transactions across a network of computers.
* Offers transparency, immutability, and security for data storage.

### `Solidity:`

* High-level programming language for creating smart contracts.
* Smart contracts are self-executing agreements deployed on a blockchain.
* Solidity is specifically designed for Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

### `Web3:`

* JavaScript library providing interaction with Ethereum and similar blockchains.
* Acts as a bridge between your frontend application and the blockchain.
* Enables actions like sending transactions, querying data, and listening for events.


By combining these technologies, we can develop DApps that leverage the power of blockchain for secure, transparent interactions.
